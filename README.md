# **MiniProject_Java_OOP**

The To-Do app uses OOP principles to manage tasks. **Encapsulation** keeps task data within the Task class, **Abstraction** simplifies user interactions, and **Polymorphism** can be used for future extensions. It allows users to add, mark, and view tasks with deadlines, helping them stay organized.
